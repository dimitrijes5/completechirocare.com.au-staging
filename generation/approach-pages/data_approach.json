There can, also, be numbness and tingling sensations. The symptoms of sciatica can be debilitating for the sufferer, making daily mobility a challenge. The sciatic nerve is located in the lower back and it is the largest and widest nerve in the human body. Lower back pain and sciatica are increasingly common complaints in our modern world. It is estimated that around 10% of all lower back pain sufferers will experience a degree of sciatic nerve pain. Sciatica can be a painful problem during pregnancy and it can affect people of all ages. Chiropractic treatments are effective in reducing the symptoms of sciatica and helping the body to overcome the condition."

This condition affects our spinal joints and results in inflammation around the degenerating vertebrae facet joints. These joints are responsible for our spinal mobility and allow for a wide range of movements. The symptoms of Spondolyosis are localised and radiating pain emanating from the spinal joints affected. Stiffness and reduced movement in the affected joints make getting around a painful challenge for many sufferers. Sufferers may experience Cervical Spondolyosis, Thoracic Spondolyosis; Lumbar Spondolyosis or Multilevel Spondolyosis. The neck, shoulders, arms, hands and fingers are affected by Cervical Spondolyosis. The Lumbar version will target lower back, buttocks, legs, feet and toes. Thoracic will involve pain in the abdomen, upper back and middle back. Chiropractic treatments can help with the management and care of these conditions."

Chiropractic care is well placed to treat chronic pain, because we centre our treatments around the spine. Spinal manipulations may help relieve pain by going to the source of your problem. Painful neck and back conditions can be successfully treated by a well-trained and experienced chiropractic practitioner. At Complete Chiropractic, we offer natural, non-surgical, treatments to manage and cure these structurally based chronic conditions."

Basically, your sensory perception of the world is askew and this affects your sense of balance. Awareness of vertigo in Australia was heightened by the experiences of champion golfer, Jason Day, during a recent US Open tournament.

We understand the role of the inner ear and balance through research into things like sea sickness. BPPV frequently occurs in association with ageing but is not confined to older human beings.

Headaches are, often, associated with certain types of neck pain. Some of the causes are: sports injury, poor posture, sleeping in the wrong position, neck trauma, and repetitive strain injuries.

Our mobility is inextricably connected to our functioning hip joints. When we experience hip pain and chronic conditions like this, it makes it very difficult to get on with our lives. Osteoarthritis is, probably, the most prevalent form of hip pain that we see, especially in older Australians. Wear and tear over the years can cause stiffness, inflammation and a degeneration of the joints. There are other causes of hip pain like Sciatica, sports injury, traumatic injuries and other inflammatory diseases. Hip pain can be localised within the hip joint itself or emanate from the structures and ligaments, which surround the joint. Inflammation can trigger hip pain within the joint and outside via the bursa sac. Bursitis is the name for inflammation of either of the bursae within the hip. This type of pain can be particularly bad at night, as it is difficult for the sufferer to avoid lying on the affected hip. Chiropractic treatments can alleviate and reduce hip pain. In many instances, chiropractic care can be a better choice than relying on pharmaceutical pain killers for prolonged periods of your life. Quality of life is, often, best served by a natural solution to chronic conditions like hip pain."

Footballers are too often tearing their anterior and interior cruciate ligaments to the detriment of their sporting careers. As chiropractors, we see an awful lot of knee complaints from sports injuries, accidents, arthritis, and wear and tear, more generally. Knees can swell up and sufferers can experience a considerable amount of pain from conditions such as these. Our lives today demand greater flexibility; and our knee joints play a commanding role in being able to deliver this ability to bend when necessary. Stiff joints are not much fun and they make life far more challenging."

One of the most common causes we find is that a large proportion of headaches are cervicogenic in nature – that is coming from the neck and shoulders. When neck pain relief is provided and effectively treated with chiropractic – symptoms can resolve. This is our primary focus at Complete Chiropractic in Dee Why."

It is a narrow passageway formed by the carpal bones within the wrist, which houses the median nerve. The median nerve connects the hand to the cervical spine. CTS involves the compression of this nerve resulting in pain, numbness, and may weaken grip strength over time.
