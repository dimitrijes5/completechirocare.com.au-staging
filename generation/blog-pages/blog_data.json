A likely cause of internal disc degradation is traumatic compression injury causing end plate fracture and exposing the nucleus pulposus to the circulation. This initiates the degeneration of the nucleus pulposus leading to internal disc disruption (Bogduk 1990)."

Ultimately the plan is to take the forwardness out of the posture especially at the level of the spondylolislethisis.  Another goal is to teach ways to avoid overstressing the back so that re–injury doesn’t occur. If you have any of the signs described above please contact complete chiropractic Dee Why and find out if we may be able to help improve your quality of life."

Most of the women who see me won’t seek help from general practitioners because they don’t want to take drugs, so instead they seek help from alternative modalities. The complicating factor for pregnant women is that their spinal curves become exaggerated while they’re pregnant. Hands-on practitioners usually place their patients facedown while they treat them, however, a pregnant woman can’t and shouldn’t hold this position for long. Combined with the baby’s weight, this pulls the spine forward into an extreme arch, placing pressure on the discs and joints and irritating the nerves and muscles. For this reason in particular, traditional chiropractic, osteopathy and massage aren’t well suited to pregnant women."

Exercise or stretches during the late stages of pregnancy are also difficult. As I mentioned previously, simply ‘holding’ a body upright is difficult and for pregnant women, this is even more true as their necks compensate for the lower back changes that occur with a growing belly. Doing any exercise on your back during pregnancy is not advisable because the weight of the uterus presses on the veins and arteries, which reduces blood flow from the legs back to the heart. Overheating the body through exercise also isn’t advisable as it can put stress on the baby, who doesn’t have the ability to cool itself down."

It is connected to the thighbone (femur) and helps with hip rotation. The sciatic nerve runs under the piriformis muscle. This muscle is prone to injury from slipping or falling, arthritis in the hip, or a difference in length of the leg. Such things can cause cramping and spasm to develop in the piriformis muscle, which may pinch the sciatic nerve and causes pain and inflammation. Contraction of the piriformis muscle and/or muscle spasms can lead to pain along the back of the thigh, down to the knee, which can cause a possible loss of sensation or numbness and tingling in the sole of the foot. Pain that radiates down the leg from sciatic nerve irritation (Sciatica) can result from different causes, of which Piriformis Syndrome is one. This complaint may be helped with Chiropractic care."

As your little baby grows and develops the mother’s body morphs to the change and accommodates for the growing baby inside. Your breasts become bigger to prepare for breastfeeding, the lower back curve in your low back increases as your belly becomes larger in size, and your head tends to move forward to maintain itself over your toes. It’s true that perhaps not all these changes to a woman’s body sound ideal, however they are the changes necessary to keep a woman able to move around over the course of her pregnancy. Undergoing chiropractic care may help make pregnancy a healthy and comfortable thing."

Any damage to the head prompts swelling and gathering of liquid in and around the brain; and when the tissues begin to swell and increase in size, it causes increased pressure inside the skull (intracranial pressure) and this result to a post-traumatic headache."

Numerous muscles and structures surround the shoulder which helps in giving motion and stability to the area. However, there are instances when the shoulder capsule can become very tight. When this happens, it will bring about critical limitation of normal shoulder rotation. Frozen Shoulder is a painful and disabling disorder of unclear cause. The pain is typically constant, more terrible around evening time, and with cold weather. Certain movements or bumps can provoke episodes of tremendous pain and cramping. It can be made worse by your posture being out of the normal line."
