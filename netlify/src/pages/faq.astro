        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">ABC™ seems to be all about posture. Why is posture so important?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-700">Good posture is not just about your physical appearance, although it’s true that poor posture can make you look older. Posture is one of the key indicators of your overall health; if your posture is poor, it can result in range of symptoms such as poor sleep, lack of energy, pain and tension, reduced breathing capacity, lowered immunity and an older appearance that can reduce your quality of life.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What are the causes of poor posture?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-700">Causes of poor posture include: long term use of devices, like computers, that cause you to sit in a hunched position for long periods of time; injuries, such as sporting injuries, car accidents and falls; and hereditary disorders, such as scoliosis and osteoporosis.</p>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-700 mt-2">In today’s world, children are developing problems with their posture at a much more rapid rate than previous generations, due largely to the prolonged periods they spent sitting in front of computers and other electronic devices.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What are the signs of poor posture?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-700">The most common sign of poor posture is forward displacement of the head, known as Forward Head Posture (FHP). When your head is pushed forward, it pulls against your neck, back, shoulders and chest and can also push your hips out of alignment to compensate.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Are spinal adjustments painful?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-700">ABC™ is a painless and surprisingly fast method of chiropractic treatment. The doctor will treat you using only his hands, bending your body using rotary movements. However, conventional chiropractic techniques like twisting are not used in ABC™ treatments.</p>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-700 mt-2">Some patients will experience a slight muscle ache the day after having their spine adjusted; this is normal and will usually pass within 24 hours.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How long will it take before I see results?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-700">Many patients start seeing results after their first treatment. Patients with more severe conditions may need a few weeks of treatment before they can really see or feel a difference.</p>

      <section class="border-b border-gray-300 pb-6">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">If I feel better after a few weeks of treatment, does that mean I’m cured?</h2>
        <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-gray-700">If you’ve been living with pain for a long time, then you may think your problem is fixed as soon as the pain goes away. However, what we’re aiming for is not just a treatment of the symptoms, but a treatment of the underlying causes and this can take time. The duration of your treatment plan depends on your individual symptoms, so make an appointment to talk through your needs with Dr Zahedi.</p>
